Introduction: *A common pattern is to poll endpoints to get the most recent updates from an api or service if they don't offer a push based service like server-sent events or websockets. In this guide we will show how you can use bytewax to create a data stream by polling an endpoint using the PeriodicInput connector (Available in > v0.17). In our code we will publish the data stream to a Redpanda topic, so it can be used by multiple services downstream.*

## ****Prerequisites****

**Kafka/Redpanda**

Before starting this guide, you will need to have Redpanda (or kafka) installed. You should have some familiarity with how to setup Redpanda.

**Postgres**

**Python modules**
